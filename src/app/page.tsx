  body: `Hi Alex,

I hope you're doing well! It's been a busy week on our end, but I wanted to touch base on a few things regarding the **website redesign project**. I know you've been juggling a lot lately, so I appreciate you taking the time to look into this.

First, we're approaching the **March 15th deadline**, and I wanted to check in to see if we're still on track. If there are any hiccups, let's address them sooner rather than later‚ÄîI'd hate for us to be scrambling at the last minute. Also, the finance team mentioned they're reviewing the **$12,500 budget** we proposed. Have you heard anything from them? I know budgets can be a bit of a headache, so I'm happy to help nudge things along if needed.

On another note, the client has been really enthusiastic about the progress so far, which is great! They've asked for a **mid-project review meeting**, and I was thinking **Wednesday, March 8th** might work. Let me know if that fits your schedule. Oh, and one last thing‚Äîwe're running a bit lean on resources, so I was wondering if we could bring in **three more team members** starting **next Monday**. I know it's a bit of an ask, but it would really help us stay on track without burning out the current team.

Thanks so much for your help with all of this, Alex. I know it's a lot, but I really appreciate how proactive you've been throughout the project. Let me know if there's anything I can do to make things easier on your end!

Best regards,\nJordan Lee\nProject Manager`
